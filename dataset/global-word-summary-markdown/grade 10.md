### **Grade 10, Chapter 1: The Idea of the Nation**

### **The Rise of Nationalism in Europe**

**(PAGE 1)**

### **The Birth of We: How an Imagined Family Conquered a Continent**

What is a nation? Is it the land you live on? The language you speak? The king you serve? For most of history, people didn't think in terms of being "French" or "German." They were subjects of a king, residents of a village, or members of a clan. But starting with the **French Revolution** in 1789, a powerful and dangerous new idea swept across Europe: the idea of the **nation-state**. This was the belief that every group of people with a shared culture, language, and history had the right to their own independent country. This idea, **nationalism**, would tear old empires apart and build new countries from their ashes.

**From Revolution to Empire**
The French Revolution was the spark. It transferred power from the monarch to the citizens and created a new sense of collective identity with a flag (the Tricolour), a national anthem (the Marseillaise), and a common language. The revolutionary armies, and later the emperor **Napoleon**, marched across Europe, and wherever they went, they carried these revolutionary ideas with them. Ironically, Napoleon's conquests also sparked nationalism in the peoples he conquered, who began to define themselves in opposition to French rule.

**The Age of Revolutions: 1830-1848**
After Napoleon's defeat, the old conservative monarchies tried to turn back the clock. But the genie of nationalism was out of the bottle. A series of revolutions swept across Europe in **1830** and **1848**, as liberals and nationalists in Italy, Germany, Poland, and Greece rose up against their aristocratic rulers, demanding constitutional governments and national unification. Most of these revolutions were crushed, but they showed that the fire of nationalism could not be extinguished. Culture became a key weapon: folk songs, poetry, and language were used to create a sense of shared heritage, a process championed by thinkers like the German philosopher **Johann Gottfried Herder**.

**Unity Through Blood and Iron: Germany and Italy**
For centuries, "Germany" and "Italy" were just geographical expressions, a patchwork of dozens of small kingdoms and states. The dream of unifying them was finally achieved not by revolutionaries, but by cunning and conservative state leaders. In Prussia, the brilliant and ruthless Chief Minister, **Otto von Bismarck**, used a policy of **"blood and iron"**—meaning warfare—to unite the German states. After a series of short, decisive wars against Denmark, Austria, and France, the new **German Empire** was proclaimed in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles in 1871. A similar process of political maneuvering and warfare, led by figures like **Cavour** and **Garibaldi**, led to the creation of a unified **Kingdom of Italy**. By the late 19th century, the map of Europe had been redrawn. The age of the nation-state had arrived.

### **Meanwhile, Across the Globe...**
While Europe was consumed by the fires of nationalism, most of the rest of the world was being consumed by European **imperialism**. The very same sense of national pride and destiny that was unifying Germany and Italy was also fueling a race for colonies in Africa and Asia. The **"Scramble for Africa"** saw European powers carve up an entire continent. In **India**, after the great revolt of 1857 was crushed, a new sense of Indian nationalism was just beginning to emerge in response to British rule. In the **United States**, the nation was healing from its own brutal **Civil War**, a conflict fought to preserve its own national unity. And in **Japan**, the **Meiji Restoration** of 1868 saw a group of reformers overthrow the old feudal system and begin a rapid process of modernization and industrialization, creating their own powerful brand of Japanese nationalism to compete with the West.

### **Connecting the Past to the Present**
*   **Then (Direct Connections):** The rise of nationalism in Europe had a profound and direct impact on the development of nationalism in India. Early Indian nationalist leaders were deeply inspired by the stories of the Italian unification movement, seeing figures like **Giuseppe Mazzini** as heroes. They studied how European nationalists had used culture, language, and history to forge a sense of unity and tried to apply those lessons to the vastly more diverse context of India. The European model of a nation-state became the ideal that many Indian leaders aspired to.
*   **Now (Lasting Impact & Parallels):** The nation-state, born in Europe in the 19th century, has become the default political unit for the entire world. The institutions we take for granted—passports, national flags, anthems, and a sense of belonging to a "nation"—are all products of this era. However, the legacy of European nationalism is also a dark one. The belief that one's own nation is superior to others led directly to the aggressive imperialism of the 19th century and the catastrophic world wars of the 20th. Today, the world continues to grapple with the dangerous side of nationalism, from ethnic conflicts and civil wars to the rise of populist, nationalist leaders in many countries. The story of its birth in Europe is a lesson in both its power to unite and its terrible potential to destroy.

### **Grade 10, Chapter 2: The Awakening of a Giant**

### **Nationalism in India**

**(PAGE 1)**

### **The Soul of a Nation: How India Fought for Freedom**

How do you forge a single nation out of a subcontinent of dizzying diversity, with hundreds of languages and multiple faiths? The story of **nationalism in India** is not just a story of political struggle against the British; it is the story of how millions of people came to see themselves as part of a shared civilization with a common destiny. It was a movement that blended Western ideas of liberty with ancient Indian philosophies, and it was ultimately led by a man who wielded the most unusual weapon in the history of revolutions: **non-violence**.

**The Great War and a New Hope**
The **First World War (1914-18)** was a turning point. India contributed a huge number of soldiers and resources to the British war effort, and people expected political rewards in return. Instead, they got the repressive **Rowlatt Act** (which allowed for detention without trial) and the horrific **Jallianwala Bagh massacre** of 1919, where British troops fired on a peaceful crowd, killing hundreds. This act of brutality shocked the nation and turned millions against the British. It was into this charged atmosphere that **Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi** emerged as the undisputed leader of the freedom struggle.

**The Age of Gandhi: Satyagraha in Action**
Gandhi brought a completely new method of struggle: **Satyagraha**, or "truth force." This was not passive resistance; it was an active, non-violent confrontation with injustice. He believed that by willingly suffering, you could appeal to the conscience of your oppressor. He also brought the freedom struggle out of the drawing rooms of the elite and took it to the villages, mobilizing peasants, workers, and women.

He launched three major pan-Indian movements. The **Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22)** was a massive boycott of British goods, schools, and courts, linked with the **Khilafat movement** to ensure Hindu-Muslim unity. The **Civil Disobedience Movement** began in 1930 with the famous **Dandi Salt March**, where Gandhi and his followers marched to the sea to make their own salt, openly defying the British salt monopoly. The final call came with the **Quit India Movement** in 1942, a mass uprising demanding the British leave immediately.

**A Nation Forged in Culture**
But nationalism wasn't just about protests and politics. It was also forged in culture. Artists like **Abanindranath Tagore** pioneered a new style of painting that drew on Indian traditions, rejecting the Western style. The image of **Bharat Mata** (Mother India) became a powerful symbol. Nationalists began collecting folk songs and legends to discover the "soul" of the nation. The adoption of the tricolour flag and the singing of songs like **Vande Mataram** all helped to create a sense of collective belonging and a shared national identity, ready to claim its freedom.

**(PAGE 2)**

### **Meanwhile, Across the Globe...**
The Indian national movement was a leading voice in a global chorus of **anti-colonialism**. In **Vietnam**, nationalists led by **Ho Chi Minh** were fighting a long and bloody struggle against French colonial rule, inspired by both nationalism and communism. In **China**, after a period of civil war, the Communist Party led by **Mao Zedong** would eventually triumph in 1949. Across the **Middle East**, Arab nationalists were fighting for independence from British and French control. The **Great Depression** of the 1930s had weakened the economic grip of the imperial powers, and **World War II (1939-45)** delivered the final blow. The war exhausted Britain and France, and the new superpowers, the **USA** and the **USSR**, were both, for their own reasons, opposed to the old European colonial empires. The age of empire was ending, and the age of decolonization was beginning.

### **Connecting the Past to the Present**
*   **Then (Direct Connections):** The Indian freedom struggle was deeply intertwined with global events. Gandhi's own philosophy was shaped during his time fighting racial discrimination in **South Africa**. The global economic crisis of the Great Depression hit Indian peasants and traders hard, fueling their anger against the British. The weakening of the British Empire during WWII was a crucial factor that convinced the British government that they could no longer hold on to India, their "jewel in the crown." Indian leaders were in close contact with other anti-colonial movements, seeing their struggle as part of a worldwide fight for freedom.
*   **Now (Lasting Impact & Parallels):** The Indian freedom struggle, and especially the Gandhian method of non-violent resistance, became a global template for social and political change. It directly inspired the **American Civil Rights Movement**, with leaders like **Martin Luther King Jr.** frequently referring to Gandhi as his political mentor. It also inspired the **anti-apartheid movement** in South Africa and numerous other peace and justice movements around the world. The challenge that the Indian nationalists faced—how to build a united, secular, and democratic nation from a diverse population—is a challenge that many multicultural societies still grapple with today, making the Indian story a powerful and relevant example.

8.  **Documentary: *The Day India Burned: Partition* (BBC):** A powerful documentary that uses archival footage and survivor testimonies to tell the story of the tragic Partition of India that accompanied independence.

### **Food for Thought:**
Gandhi's strategy of non-violence was unique. Do you think this strategy would have worked against a more ruthless opponent, like the Nazis in Germany? Or was it only successful because the British had a certain level of moral conscience?

### **Grade 10, Chapter 3: The World Gets Smaller**

### **The Making of a Global World**

**(PAGE 1)**

### **Silk, Silver, and Sickness: A History of Our Connected World**

Long before the internet, airplanes, or even steamships, the world was already connected. For thousands of years, people, goods, ideas, and even diseases have been moving across vast distances, weaving the fates of different continents together. This process, which we now call **globalization**, is not a new phenomenon. From the ancient **Silk Roads** that linked China to Europe, to the age of discovery that connected the Americas to the rest of the world, our history is the story of an ever-shrinking planet.

**The Pre-Modern World: A Web of Silk and Spices**
For centuries, the most famous of these connections were the Silk Roads, a network of overland and sea routes that carried precious Chinese silk, Indian spices, and Roman gold back and forth across Eurasia. But it wasn't just goods that traveled. Travelers like Marco Polo and Ibn Battuta brought back stories and knowledge. Religions like Buddhism and Christianity spread along these same routes. But this connectivity had a dark side. The same routes that carried silk also carried the bacteria that caused the Black Death, which wiped out a huge portion of Europe's population in the 14th century.

**The Great Exchange: When Worlds Collided**
The world was truly "made" global after **Christopher Columbus**'s accidental "discovery" of the Americas in 1492. This kicked off the **Columbian Exchange**, a massive transfer of plants, animals, diseases, and people between the Old World (Europe, Asia, Africa) and the New World (the Americas). Foods like potatoes, tomatoes, maize, and chilies, unknown outside the Americas, spread across the world and transformed global diets. But European diseases like smallpox, to which the native Americans had no immunity, devastated their populations, making it easy for the Europeans to conquer them. The vast silver mines of Peru and Mexico fueled the European economy and financed its trade with Asia. And the demand for labor on sugar and cotton plantations in the Americas led to the horrific **transatlantic slave trade**, which forcibly transported millions of Africans in one of the darkest chapters of human history.

**The 19th Century: The Age of Steam and Steel**
The 19th century saw globalization accelerate dramatically, driven by the **Industrial Revolution**. Three types of flows were key: the flow of **trade** (as Britain exported factory goods), the flow of **labor** (as millions of Europeans migrated to the Americas and Australia, and millions of Indian and Chinese **indentured laborers** were sent to work on plantations and mines across the globe), and the flow of **capital** (as London bankers invested in railways and infrastructure all over the world). The steamship, the railway, and the telegraph made the world smaller and faster than ever before. But this was an unequal globalization, one where a handful of powerful industrial nations, led by Great Britain, dominated the world economy, often through colonial exploitation. The system came crashing down with the **First World War** and the **Great Depression**, only to be reborn in a new form after 1945.

**(PAGE 2)**

### **Meanwhile, in India...**
India was absolutely central to this story of globalization, but often as a victim rather than a beneficiary. In the pre-modern era, India was a major hub of the Indian Ocean trade network, a source of highly desired textiles and spices. But in the 19th century, under British rule, its role changed dramatically. India became a crucial market for British manufactured goods and a massive supplier of raw materials like raw cotton, indigo, and opium. Most significantly, India became a major exporter of **indentured labor**. After the abolition of slavery, hundreds of thousands of poor Indians were recruited under harsh contracts (**indenture**) to work in places like the Caribbean, Mauritius, Fiji, and Malaya. They were the human fuel for the global colonial economy.

### **Connecting the Past to the Present**
*   **Then (Direct Connections):** The global economy of the 19th century was built on a foundation of colonialism, and India was its cornerstone. The wealth extracted from India helped finance British industrialization and its global investments. The opium grown by Indian peasants was used to force open the Chinese market. And the Indian taxpayers even paid for the administration and army that maintained British rule. India was not just participating in the global world; it was being actively integrated into a system designed to benefit Britain.
*   **Now (Lasting Impact & Parallels):** The patterns of globalization established in the 19th century have a long legacy. The economic inequality between the industrialized "Global North" and the formerly colonized "Global South" is a direct result of this history. The large Indian diaspora communities in countries like Trinidad, Fiji, South Africa, and Malaysia are a living legacy of the indenture system. Today's globalization, driven by multinational corporations and digital technology, is much faster, but it raises similar questions about inequality, labor exploitation, and the power of global capital that were first seen in the 19th century. The COVID-19 pandemic was a stark reminder of the dark side of connectivity, showing how quickly a virus can travel across a globalized world, just as the Black Death did along the Silk Roads.

### **Grade 10, Chapter 4: The Age of the Machine**

### **The Age of Industrialisation**

**(PAGE 1)**

### **The Roar of the Factory: How Machines Remade the World**

Before the 18th century, most things were made by hand, in small workshops or in people's homes. Life followed the rhythm of the seasons. But then, a series of inventions in Britain, starting with the textile industry, unleashed a new and powerful force: the factory. This **Age of Industrialisation** was a revolution that changed not just how things were made, but how people lived, worked, and thought. It created immense new wealth and power, but also new forms of poverty and social conflict.

**Before the Factory: Proto-Industrialisation**
Even before the rise of big factories, a large-scale industrial production system existed for the international market. This is called **proto-industrialisation**. Merchants in the towns would provide cash advances to peasant families in the countryside, who would then spin thread and weave cloth in their homes during the time they weren't busy in the fields. The finished cloth would then be collected by the merchant and sold in the cities. This system allowed the peasants to supplement their income and the merchants to get around the powerful urban craft guilds.

**The Coming of the Machine**
The real revolution began in the late 18th century with a series of inventions. The **spinning jenny**, the **water frame**, and later, **steam power**, allowed for the mass production of cotton textiles in large factories, mainly in cities like Manchester. This was followed by a boom in the **iron and steel** industry, fueled by the demand for machinery and railways. The **pace of industrial change** was initially slow, with traditional crafts co-existing with the new factories for a long time. But by the mid-19th century, the factory had become the symbol of the new industrial age.

**The Life of the Worker**
For the **workers**, industrialization was a mixed and often brutal experience. The new factories attracted thousands of migrants from the countryside, leading to overcrowded, unsanitary cities. Work in the factories was long, dangerous, and monotonous. Wages were low, and unemployment was common. Women and children were often employed because they could be paid less. This led to social unrest and the rise of the first **trade unions**, as workers began to organize to demand better wages and working conditions. But despite the hardship, many people were also attracted by the new opportunities and the sense of freedom that city life offered compared to the rigid hierarchies of the countryside.

**Industrialisation in the Colony**
When the Industrial Revolution came to India, it was a very different story. Before the British, India had a thriving textile industry. But the flood of cheap, machine-made cloth from Manchester destroyed the livelihood of millions of Indian weavers. The new factories that did come up in India in the late 19th century were mainly in sectors like cotton and jute, and for a long time, they were dominated by European firms. Indian industrialists faced tough competition and discriminatory government policies. However, visionary entrepreneurs like **Jamsetji Tata** began to build a modern Indian industrial base, a crucial step in the journey towards economic self-reliance.

**(PAGE 2)**

### **Meanwhile, Across the Globe...**
While Britain was the first industrial nation, others were quick to follow. In the second half of the 19th century, the **United States** and **Germany** experienced explosive industrial growth, eventually overtaking Britain in the production of steel and chemicals. In **Russia**, the government pushed a state-led industrialization drive in the late 19th century. In **Japan**, the **Meiji Restoration** of 1868 sparked a miraculously fast industrial transformation, as Japan deliberately copied Western technology to avoid being colonized itself. In contrast, most of the colonized world in Asia and Africa was actively **de-industrialized**, its traditional crafts destroyed and its economies re-oriented to serve as suppliers of raw materials for the factories of Europe and North America.

### **Connecting the Past to the Present**
*   **Then (Direct Connections):** The Industrial Revolution in Britain and the de-industrialization of India were two sides of the same imperial coin. Britain's factories needed two things from India: a source of cheap raw materials (like raw cotton) and a captive market to sell their finished goods (like Manchester cloth). Colonial policies were deliberately designed to create this relationship. The railways built by the British in India were primarily to facilitate this extraction of raw materials and distribution of finished goods.
*   **Now (Lasting Impact & Parallels):** We are all living in a world shaped by the Industrial Revolution. The technologies we use, the way our cities are designed, and the global economic system are all its descendants. The environmental problems we face today, like climate change, have their roots in the industrial age's massive consumption of fossil fuels. The social and economic debates that began then—about workers' rights, the gap between rich and poor, and the role of government in regulating industry—are still the central debates of our time. The rise of new industrial powers like China and India in the late 20th and 21st centuries is, in many ways, a replay of the industrial catch-up that Germany and the US played in the 19th century.

### **Grade 10, Chapter 5: The Power of the Page**

### **Print Culture and the Modern World**

**(PAGE 1)**

### **The Revolution in Black and White: How Print Changed Everything**

Before the invention of printing, books were rare and precious objects, painstakingly copied by hand. Knowledge was the property of a small elite. But the invention of the **printing press** changed everything. It made books cheap and plentiful, allowing ideas to spread faster and further than ever before. This **print revolution** was not just a technological change; it sparked religious reformations, political revolutions, and the rise of modern science. It democratized knowledge and gave a voice to the voiceless.

**From Woodblocks to Gutenberg's Press**
The earliest kind of printing developed in **China**, using a system of rubbing paper against inked **woodblocks**. This technology spread to Japan and Korea. But the real breakthrough happened in Europe in the 1440s, when **Johann Gutenberg** in Germany developed the first printing press with movable metal type. This was a revolutionary invention. A skilled scribe might produce one book in a few months; Gutenberg's press could produce hundreds of copies in the same amount of time.

**The Press and the People: Reformation, Science, and Revolution**
The impact was immediate and explosive. The first thing Gutenberg printed was the **Bible**. For the first time, people could read the sacred texts for themselves, without relying on priests. This was a key factor in the **Protestant Reformation**, led by **Martin Luther**. His criticisms of the Catholic Church were printed in thousands of pamphlets and spread across Germany in weeks, something that would have been impossible before the press.

Print also fueled the **Scientific Revolution**, as the ideas and discoveries of scientists like Isaac Newton could be quickly shared and debated by a Europe-wide scientific community. Later, in the 18th century, the writings of Enlightenment thinkers like **Voltaire** and **Rousseau**, which were critical of monarchy and religious dogma, circulated widely, helping to create the intellectual climate for the **French Revolution**. Rulers and religious authorities were terrified of the power of print and tried to control it through censorship, but they couldn't stop the flood of new ideas.

**Print Comes to India**
In India, print arrived with the Portuguese missionaries in the 16th century. But it was in the late 18th and 19th centuries that it really took off. A vibrant world of vernacular newspapers and journals emerged. These became a crucial tool for the **national movement**, used by leaders to criticize colonial rule, share their ideas, and create a sense of a pan-Indian community. Print also fueled intense debates on social and religious issues. Reformers used it to attack practices like sati and caste discrimination, while orthodox groups used it to defend their traditions. For **women**, print was a double-edged sword. While some read sensational novels that reinforced traditional roles, many others, like **Rashsundari Debi** and **Pandita Ramabai**, used it to write about their own lives and experiences, challenging the silence imposed on them by a patriarchal society.

**(PAGE 2)**

### **Meanwhile, Across the Globe...**
The 19th century was the golden age of print. The invention of steam-powered presses and cheap, mass-produced paper made newspapers, magazines, and novels accessible to the masses for the first time. In **Great Britain**, novelists like **Charles Dickens** published their work in serial form in magazines, reaching a huge audience. In the **United States**, newspapers played a huge role in shaping public opinion during the **Civil War**, and cheap "dime novels" became wildly popular. In **Japan**, after the Meiji Restoration, a flourishing print culture helped to spread ideas about Westernization and modernity. The printed word was the primary medium of mass communication, the internet of its day.

### **Connecting the Past to the Present**
*   **Then (Direct Connections):** The printing presses and technologies used in India were imported from Europe. The very idea of a newspaper as a tool for public debate and political critique was a Western one, which Indian nationalists brilliantly adapted for their own purposes. The British colonial government was deeply alarmed by the power of the Indian vernacular press. They passed a series of repressive laws, like the **Vernacular Press Act of 1878**, to try and censor and control newspapers that were critical of their rule, showing just how much they feared the power of the printed word.
*   **Now (Lasting Impact & Parallels):** The print revolution fundamentally changed the way we think and access information. It created the very idea of a "public sphere" where ideas can be debated. The role that print played in the 19th century is a direct historical parallel to the role that the **internet and social media** play today. Both technologies dramatically lowered the cost of spreading information, gave a platform to new voices, enabled mass social and political movements, and created new "imagined communities." And just like the rulers of the past who tried to censor the press, modern governments around the world are now grappling with how to control (or censor) the flow of information on the internet. The battle for the freedom of the press is a direct legacy of the revolution that began with Gutenberg.

### **Food for Thought:**
The printing press gave a voice to reformers and revolutionaries, but it also allowed hateful and false ideas to spread. Is the free flow of information always a good thing, or does it need to be controlled?
