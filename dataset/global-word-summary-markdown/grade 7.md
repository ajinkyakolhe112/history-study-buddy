### **Grade 7, Chapter 1: The World in Flux**

### **Tracing Changes Through a Thousand Years**

**(PAGE 1)**

### **The Map is Not the Territory: A Thousand Years of Change**

Have you ever looked at an old map and noticed how different it looks from a modern one? Coastlines might be wonky, familiar countries might have strange names, and entire continents might be missing. Maps change because our knowledge of the world changes. Now, imagine that everything—not just maps, but languages, religions, food, technology, and social groups—is constantly changing. That’s what this book is about: a thousand-year period (from roughly 700 to 1750 CE) in Indian history where the world was in constant flux, a time we call the **medieval period**.

**A Foreigner Today, A Friend Tomorrow**
Even the meaning of words changes. Today, we might use the word "foreigner" for someone from another country. But in medieval India, a "foreigner" (**pardesi** or **ajnabi**) was simply someone who was not part of your village or society, even if they were Indian. A city-dweller might see a forest-dweller as a foreigner. The very idea of **“Hindustan”** also changed. In the 13th century, the chronicler Minhaj-i-Siraj used the term to describe only the areas of Punjab, Haryana, and the lands between the Ganga and Yamuna—the heartland of the Delhi Sultanate. A few centuries later, the poet Amir Khusrau used the word “Hind” to mean the culture and people of the entire subcontinent. The idea of India as a single political nation-state didn't exist yet.

**Finding Clues in a New Age**
To understand this changing world, historians use a new set of clues. **Inscriptions** on temple walls and copper plates still tell us about land grants and kings' victories. **Coins** stamped with the names and dates of rulers help us map out kingdoms. **Architecture**—the magnificent forts and temples built by kings—shows us their power and artistic tastes. But the biggest change is the explosion of written records. Paper became widely available, so people started writing everything down: holy texts, chronicles of rulers' reigns, letters and teachings of saints, court petitions, and tax records. These **textual records** give us a much more detailed picture of life than we had for the ancient period.

**New People, New Technologies**
This was also an era of new arrivals and dramatic new technologies. Entirely new social and political groups, like the **Rajputs**—a warrior clan that became hugely important in north India—emerged on the scene. New technologies that came to the subcontinent included the **Persian wheel** for irrigation, the **spinning wheel** for weaving cloth, and **firearms** in combat. Even new foods and beverages arrived, like potatoes, corn, chilies, tea, and coffee. This was not a static, unchanging India; it was a dynamic, multicultural world where people, ideas, and technologies were constantly moving and mixing.

### **Meanwhile, Across the Globe...**
As the medieval period began in India, the world was being reshaped by powerful new forces. In the Middle East, the religion of **Islam** had exploded out of Arabia and created a vast empire, the **Caliphate**, stretching from Spain to the borders of India. Its new capital, **Baghdad**, became the world's leading center for science, medicine, and philosophy. In Europe, the Western Roman Empire was long gone, replaced by a collection of feudal kingdoms. The most powerful ruler was **Charlemagne**, who was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 800 CE, creating a brief moment of unity. And far away in the Americas, the **Maya civilization** was at its peak in the jungles of Mesoamerica, building stunning pyramids and developing a highly advanced system of mathematics and astronomy.

### **Connecting the Past to the Present**
*   **Then (Direct Connections):** The rise of the Islamic Caliphate had a direct and immediate impact on India. Arab traders had long visited India's west coast, but now Arab armies conquered the province of Sind in 711 CE. This established a permanent political link and opened a channel for intense cultural exchange. Indian knowledge of mathematics, medicine, and astronomy flowed westward to Baghdad, where it was translated into Arabic and studied by the world's greatest scholars.
*   **Now (Lasting Impact & Parallels):** This chapter teaches us a crucial lesson: history is about change, not just a list of events. The way terms like "Hindustan" and "foreigner" changed over time reminds us that identities are not fixed; they are constantly being negotiated. The challenge historians face when reading medieval texts—knowing that the authors had their own biases and were writing for a specific audience—is the same critical thinking skill we need today when we read a news article or watch a video online. We must always ask: Who created this, and why?

### **Explore the Era: A Top List of Engaging Media**
1.  **Video Game: *Assassin's Creed Mirage* (2023):** This game drops you into the heart of 9th-century Baghdad during its Golden Age, letting you explore the incredible city that was the world's scientific and cultural capital when medieval India was taking shape.
2.  **TV Series: *Vikings* (2013):** A gritty and thrilling drama about the Norsemen who were raiding and exploring Europe at the beginning of this period, showing the "barbarian" world that replaced the Roman Empire in the West.
3.  **Film: *Apocalypto* (2006):** A visceral and intense film directed by Mel Gibson that plunges you into the world of the ancient Maya civilization in Central America, a powerful empire that existed completely unknown to the people of India or Europe.
4.  **Book (Fiction): *The Physician* by Noah Gordon:** A historical novel about a young Christian in 11th-century London who travels to Persia to study medicine under the legendary doctor Ibn Sina (Avicenna), showcasing the superiority of medical knowledge in the Islamic world.
5.  **Video Game: *Crusader Kings III* (2020):** A grand strategy game where you can control any ruler in the medieval world, from an Indian Raja to a Viking chieftain, managing politics, war, and family dynasties across centuries.
6.  **Film: *Kingdom of Heaven* (2005):** An epic film about the Crusades, the great religious wars between Christians and Muslims in the Middle East, which was a defining feature of the high medieval period.
7.  **Documentary: *Islam: Empire of Faith* (PBS):** A beautifully made documentary that tells the story of the rise of Islam and the creation of a global civilization that had a profound and direct connection with India.
8.  **Book (Bestseller Fiction): *The Pillars of the Earth* by Ken Follett:** A sweeping novel about the building of a great cathedral in 12th-century England, immersing the reader in the daily life, politics, and faith of feudal Europe.

### **Food for Thought:**
If the meaning of words and the identity of social groups can change so much over a thousand years, what do you think might change about our world in the next thousand years?

### **Grade 7, Chapter 2: The Southern Superpowers**

### **New Kings and Kingdoms**

**(PAGE 1)**

### **The Great Game of Thrones: Rajputs, Palas, and the Mighty Cholas**

As the medieval period began, the dream of a single, unified empire gave way to a fierce and complex "game of thrones" played by ambitious new dynasties. In the north, powerful warrior clans like the **Rajputs** emerged, carving out kingdoms for themselves. But the main event was a three-way power struggle, a **tripartite struggle**, between three major dynasties: the **Gurjara-Pratiharas** of the west, the **Palas** of Bengal, and the **Rashtrakutas** of the Deccan. For centuries, these three giants fought for control of the rich and symbolic city of **Kannauj**. But while they exhausted each other, an even greater power was quietly rising in the deep south.

**The Cholas: Masters of the Southern World**
The **Chola dynasty**, which had been a minor power in the past, exploded onto the scene in the 9th century under their king **Vijayalaya**. From their heartland in the Kaveri delta, the Cholas built a massive maritime empire that would dominate South India and the Indian Ocean for over 400 years. Their two greatest emperors, **Rajaraja I** and his son **Rajendra I**, were brilliant military commanders. Rajaraja conquered vast territories, but his son went even further, leading his army all the way to the Ganga river in the north and sending his powerful navy to raid the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.

**Temples, Bronzes, and Tanks**
The Cholas were not just conquerors; they were master builders and patrons of the arts. They built magnificent stone **temples**, like the spectacular **Brihadishvara temple** in their capital, **Thanjavur**, built by Rajaraja. These temples were not just places of worship; they were the centers of the economy and society, owning vast lands and employing hundreds of people. The Cholas are also famous for their exquisite **bronze sculptures**. Using a sophisticated "lost-wax" technique, their artisans created stunning images of gods and goddesses, especially the **Nataraja** (Shiva as the lord of the dance), which are considered masterpieces of world art.

The secret to the Cholas' power was their control of agriculture. They cleared forests, built embankments to prevent flooding, and constructed a massive network of canals and irrigation **tanks** to water their fields, leading to huge agricultural surpluses. They also perfected a system of local self-government, with village assemblies called the **ur** and the **sabha** managing local affairs with remarkable efficiency. This combination of military might, artistic genius, and administrative skill made the Cholas one of the most successful and long-lasting dynasties in Indian history.

---

**(PAGE 2)**

### **Meanwhile, Across the Globe...**
While the Cholas were building their maritime empire, the world of Islam was at the peak of its **Golden Age**. The **Abbasid Caliphate** in **Baghdad** was the global center of learning. In Muslim-ruled Spain (**Al-Andalus**), cities like **Cordoba** were beacons of culture and science in an otherwise fragmented Europe. In China, the powerful and cosmopolitan **Tang Dynasty** entered a period of decline and eventually collapsed in 907 CE, leading to a time of division. In Northern Europe, the **Viking Age** was in full swing. Norse seafarers were raiding coastal towns from England to Russia, but they were also great explorers, settling Iceland, Greenland, and even reaching North America centuries before Columbus.

### **Connecting the Past to the Present**
*   **Then (Direct Connections):** The Chola empire was a major player in international maritime trade. Its ports were bustling with ships from Arabia, Persia, and China. The Cholas had strong diplomatic and commercial ties with the Tang and later the Song dynasties of China, exchanging goods and embassies. Their naval expedition to Southeast Asia was to protect their trade routes from pirates and rival kingdoms, showing that they were willing to project power far beyond their own shores to secure their economic interests. The Rashtrakutas in the Deccan also had direct trade links with the Arab world, with Arab merchants describing their kingdom as one of the world's great empires.
*   **Now (Lasting Impact & Parallels):** The Chola Nataraja bronze has become a global symbol of Indian art and philosophy; a giant statue of it even sits outside **CERN**, the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland, as a metaphor for the cosmic dance of creation and destruction. The Cholas' sophisticated system of water management and local self-government offers valuable lessons for modern societies dealing with resource management and decentralized governance. Their powerful navy and control of sea lanes are a historical precedent for the importance of maritime power in geopolitics today.

### **Explore the Era: A Top List of Engaging Media**
1.  **Book (Historical Fiction): *Ponniyin Selvan* by Kalki Krishnamurthy:** The legendary Tamil historical novel (now also a major film series) that brings the world of the early Cholas, with its political intrigue, romance, and adventure leading up to the reign of Rajaraja I, to vivid life.
2.  **Film: *Ponniyin Selvan: I & II* (2022/2023):** Mani Ratnam's spectacular cinematic adaptation of the classic novel, with stunning visuals, epic battles, and a complex plot that immerses you in the power struggles of the Chola kingdom.
3.  **Video Game: *Assassin's Creed Valhalla* (2020):** An epic open-world RPG that lets you play as a Viking warrior raiding and settling in 9th-century England, giving you a feel for the powerful Norse culture that was contemporary to the Cholas.
4.  **TV Series: *The Last Kingdom* (Netflix):** A gripping historical drama set in 9th-century England, telling the story of the fight between the Anglo-Saxons and the Viking invaders from the perspective of a Saxon raised by Vikings.
5.  **Video Game: *Crusader Kings III* (2020):** In this grand strategy game, you can play as a Chola emperor, managing your kingdom, expanding your territory, and dealing with vassals and rivals in a deeply immersive simulation.
6.  **Documentary: *India's Wondrous Water World* (National Geographic):** This documentary often features the incredible temple tanks and ancient irrigation systems of South India, showcasing the engineering genius of dynasties like the Cholas.
7.  **Book (Bestseller Fiction): *The Name of the Rose* by Umberto Eco:** A brilliant historical mystery set in a 14th-century Italian monastery, this novel captures the intellectual world of medieval Europe, where ancient knowledge was preserved and debated.
8.  **TV Series: *Knightfall* (2017):** A historical drama about the Knights Templar, the famous Catholic military order of the Crusades, showing the world of European warrior-monks.

### **Food for Thought:**
The Cholas built huge temples as a display of power and devotion. What kinds of "monuments" do powerful nations or corporations build today to show off their wealth and influence?

### **Grade 7, Chapter 3: The Sultan of Delhi**

### **The Delhi Sultans**

**(PAGE 1)**

### **The City of Djinns: Forging an Empire from Delhi**

For centuries, Delhi had been just one city among many. But in the 13th century, it was transformed into the heart of a powerful new empire: the **Delhi Sultanate**. For 300 years, five successive dynasties of Turko-Afghan rulers, known as **Sultans**, ruled from Delhi, fighting off Mongol invaders, expanding their territory, and creating a unique new Indo-Islamic culture that would change the face of North India forever.

**From Slave to Sultan**
The Sultanate began in 1206, founded by **Qutbuddin Aibak**, a former slave-general of the Afghan ruler Muhammad Ghori. This first dynasty is often called the **Slave (or Mamluk) Dynasty**. The early Sultans had a tough job: they had to control rebellious governors and defend their new kingdom. One of the greatest early sultans was **Iltutmish**, who consolidated the empire. He was so forward-thinking that he nominated his brilliant daughter, **Raziyya**, to succeed him. But the nobles couldn't accept a woman as their ruler, and her reign was tragically short.

**The Khalji Explosion and the Tughluq Experiment**
The Sultanate reached its peak under the ruthless and efficient **Alauddin Khalji**. He was a brilliant general who conquered vast parts of southern India and, most importantly, successfully defended India from multiple, massive invasions by the **Mongols**. To do this, he maintained a huge standing army and introduced radical economic reforms, including strict price controls in the markets of Delhi, to keep his soldiers' salaries low.

The Khaljis were followed by the **Tughluqs**. The most famous (and controversial) of them was **Muhammad bin Tughluq**. He was a man of brilliant but often disastrous ideas. He famously tried to move the capital from Delhi to Daulatabad in the Deccan, forcing the entire population to move, and he introduced a **"token currency"** of cheap bronze coins that was supposed to have the value of silver—a plan that backfired when people started minting fake coins in their homes. These five dynasties—the **Slave, Khalji, Tughluq, Sayyid, and Lodi**—battled to hold their empire together, using an administrative system of land grants called **iqtas** to pay their commanders.

---

**(PAGE 2)**

### **Meanwhile, Across the Globe...**
The era of the Delhi Sultanate was dominated by one terrifying name: the **Mongols**. Under **Genghis Khan** and his successors, the Mongols built the largest contiguous land empire in world history, stretching from China to Eastern Europe. They were a force of nature, destroying ancient cities like **Baghdad (1258)** and Samarkand. Their conquests completely redrew the map of Asia. In Europe, this was the High Middle Ages. Powerful kingdoms like **England** and **France** were taking shape. It was the age of knights, castles, and cathedrals. The Italian city-states of **Venice** and **Genoa** were getting rich from trade with the East, and in Florence, the early whispers of the **Renaissance** were beginning with artists like Giotto and writers like Dante. The Venetian merchant **Marco Polo** made his famous journey across Asia to China, passing by the edges of the Delhi Sultanate's world.

### **Connecting the Past to the Present**
*   **Then (Direct Connections):** The Delhi Sultanate's history was directly and profoundly shaped by the Mongols. The constant threat of Mongol invasion from the northwest forced the Sultans, especially Alauddin Khalji, to maintain a massive, expensive military, which in turn drove their economic and administrative policies. The Mongol destruction of Central Asian and Persian cities also led to a "brain drain"—a wave of scholars, poets, artists, and Sufi saints fled as refugees to the relative safety and stability of Delhi, making it a new, glittering capital of Islamic culture.
*   **Now (Lasting Impact & Parallels):** The Delhi Sultanate marks the true beginning of a new Indo-Islamic civilization that blended Indian and Turco-Persian traditions. This fusion is visible in architecture (like the Qutb Minar), music, and language. The Sultanate's administrative systems, like the iqta, laid the groundwork for the later Mughal empire. The story of Muhammad bin Tughluq's failed experiments serves as a timeless cautionary tale for governments today about the dangers of radical policies that are poorly implemented.

8.  **Book (Fiction): *The Adventures of Ibn Battuta* by Ross E. Dunn:** A fascinating book that recounts the real-life travels of the great Moroccan explorer Ibn Battuta, who spent several years in the court of Muhammad bin Tughluq in Delhi and left a priceless eyewitness account of his reign.

### **Food for Thought:**
The nobles of the Sultanate rejected Raziyya as Sultan because she was a woman. Do you think the Sultanate's history would have been different if she had been allowed to rule? Why?

### **Grade 7, Chapter 4: The Grand Mughals**

### **The Mughal Empire**

**(PAGE 1)**

### **The Empire of Diamonds: The Splendor of the Great Mughals**

In 1526, a warrior-prince from Central Asia named **Babur** rode into India with a small army and a big ambition. Armed with new-fangled cannons and a brilliant military mind, he defeated the last Delhi Sultan at the **First Battle of Panipat** and established a new dynasty: the **Mughal Empire**. For over two centuries, the Mughals would rule India, creating an empire of unparalleled wealth, power, and artistic splendor, a name that became synonymous with luxury and magnificence around the world.

**The Great Mughals: A Royal Lineage**
The story of the empire is the story of six extraordinary emperors. After Babur came his son **Humayun**, who lost the empire and then won it back. But the real architect of the empire was Humayun’s son, **Akbar the Great**. Ascending the throne as a young boy, Akbar conquered vast territories, but his true genius lay in governance. He created a sophisticated administrative system with ranked officials called **mansabdars**, who were responsible for providing soldiers for the imperial army. He also developed a detailed revenue system called **zabt** to tax the land fairly.

Most importantly, Akbar was a man of great intellectual curiosity. He held religious debates with scholars of all faiths in his "Hall of Worship" and promoted a policy of religious tolerance he called **sulh-i-kul**, or "universal peace." He treated his non-Muslim subjects with respect, a policy that helped to secure the loyalty of the powerful Rajput clans.

Akbar’s successors continued his legacy of grandeur. His son **Jahangir** and grandson **Shah Jahan** were great patrons of art and architecture. Shah Jahan's reign is famous for building one of the most beautiful buildings in the world, the **Taj Mahal**. The last of the great Mughals was **Aurangzeb**. He was a devout Muslim and a brilliant military commander who expanded the empire to its largest extent, but his long and costly wars in the Deccan drained the treasury. Unlike Akbar, he was less tolerant of other religions, which alienated many of his subjects and contributed to the empire's eventual decline.

**(PAGE 2)**

### **Meanwhile, Across the Globe...**
The age of the Great Mughals was an era of profound change and conflict in the rest of the world. In Europe, the **Protestant Reformation**, started by **Martin Luther** in 1517, had shattered the unity of the Catholic Church, leading to a century of bloody religious wars. This was also the age of the **Scientific Revolution**, with figures like **Copernicus** and **Galileo** challenging the old understanding of the universe. European powers like **Spain**, **Portugal**, **England**, and the **Netherlands** were in the full swing of the **Age of Discovery**, building vast colonial empires in the Americas and establishing trading posts in Asia. Three great Islamic "Gunpowder Empires"—the **Ottoman Empire** in the Mediterranean, the **Safavid Empire** in Persia, and the **Mughal Empire** in India—dominated the landmass from Europe to India.

### **Connecting the Past to the Present**
*   **Then (Direct Connections):** The Mughal Empire was a central node in the newly emerging global economy. European traders—the Portuguese, Dutch, English, and French—flocked to Mughal ports like Surat to buy Indian textiles, spices, and indigo, which were in huge demand in Europe. The silver that the Spanish were mining in the Americas was used to pay for these goods, meaning silver from Peru and Mexico was flowing directly into the Mughal treasury. The Mughals, Ottomans, and Safavids were also great rivals, competing for influence and prestige, but also exchanging art, ideas, and technology.
*   **Now (Lasting Impact & Parallels):** The legacy of the Mughals is all around us in India. Their magnificent architecture—the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort, Humayun's Tomb—are UNESCO World Heritage sites and defining symbols of India. Mughal cuisine, painting, and music have deeply influenced Indian culture. The administrative and revenue systems they created were so effective that they were later adopted and modified by the British. The debate between Akbar's policy of religious pluralism (*sulh-i-kul*) and Aurangzeb's religious orthodoxy remains a powerful historical parallel for modern discussions about secularism and the role of religion in the state.

### **Grade 7, Chapter 5: Monuments of Power**

### **Rulers and Buildings**

**(PAGE 1)**

### **Building for Eternity: Forts, Tombs, and Temples of Power**

Why do rulers build things? Is it just for shelter, or is there something more? In medieval India, building was a declaration. It was a way for a king to show his power, his wealth, his devotion to God, and his concern for his subjects. From towering temples that scraped the sky to magnificent tombs that seemed to defy death itself, the buildings of this era were monuments designed to project an image of majesty and secure a ruler's legacy for eternity.

**Engineering God's Home on Earth**
Between the 8th and 18th centuries, kings poured immense wealth into constructing places of worship. Hindu rulers built spectacular **temples** to demonstrate their devotion and, just as importantly, their power and status. When they defeated another king, they would often loot their rival's royal temple and take the precious idol of the deity as a trophy of war. The Chola king Rajendra I even built a temple in his new capital and filled it with statues seized from defeated rulers. These temples were incredible feats of engineering. The **Kandariya Mahadeva temple** in Khajuraho, for example, features a massive, ornate tower, or **shikhara**, designed to look like a mountain peak, the home of the gods.

**The Mughal Architectural Symphony**
The Mughals, in particular, were passionate and systematic builders. They brought with them a love for formal gardens and grand, symmetrical architecture. Babur loved creating **chahar bagh** style gardens, which were divided into four quarters by flowing water channels. This style symbolized paradise on earth. Akbar was a prolific builder, and his new capital at **Fatehpur Sikri** is a stunning fusion of Indian and Persian architectural styles.

But it was under **Shah Jahan** that Mughal architecture reached its zenith. He was a master of ceremony and design, creating magnificent audience halls in his forts at Delhi and Agra where every detail was planned to project his power as a divine king. His reign saw a shift from red sandstone to elegant white marble, often inlaid with precious stones in a beautiful technique called **pietra dura**. And of course, his most famous creation, the **Taj Mahal**, is a sublime masterpiece of symmetry, proportion, and artistic genius, a tomb for his wife that has become a timeless symbol of love and beauty.

**(PAGE 2)**

### **Meanwhile, Across the Globe...**
While Shah Jahan was building the Taj Mahal, Europe was in the midst of its **Baroque** period. This was an age of dramatic, emotional, and highly ornate art and architecture, designed to inspire awe. In Rome, the artist and architect **Gian Lorenzo Bernini** was creating spectacular fountains and completing the magnificent **St. Peter's Basilica** at the Vatican. In France, the "Sun King" **Louis XIV**, an absolute monarch much like the Mughals, was transforming a hunting lodge into the most opulent palace in the world: the **Palace of Versailles**. Its vast gardens and glittering Hall of Mirrors were designed, like Shah Jahan's forts, to overwhelm visitors with the king's power and glory. Across the Atlantic, the Spanish were building grand cathedrals in their new colonial cities like Mexico City and Lima.

### **Connecting the Past to the Present**
*   **Then (Direct Connections):** The architectural ideas of the Mughals were part of a wider Turco-Persian tradition. The distinctive bulbous dome, the grand arched gateway (pishtaq), and the use of the chahar bagh garden were all features shared with the Safavid empire in Persia and the Ottoman empire in Turkey. European travelers who visited the Mughal court, like **François Bernier**, wrote detailed accounts of the magnificent buildings, describing them for an amazed European audience. The technique of pietra dura, while perfected by the Mughals, may have been influenced by a similar Florentine craft called *pietre dure*, suggesting a flow of artistic ideas.
*   **Now (Lasting Impact & Parallels):** The architectural legacy of this period is one of India's greatest cultural treasures. The Taj Mahal is not just a tourist site; it is a UNESCO World Heritage monument and a global symbol of India itself. The practice of using architecture to project power is as alive today as it was then. Modern governments build towering skyscrapers, massive parliament buildings, and grand museums, while corporations build iconic headquarters—all designed to convey a message of prestige, innovation, and authority, just as medieval kings did with their forts and temples.

### **Grade 7, Chapter 6: The World on the Move**

### **Towns, Traders and Craftspersons**

**(PAGE 1)**

### **The Urban Explosion: Where Silk, Spices, and Money Met**

While kings and empires played their game of thrones, another, equally powerful world was flourishing in the bustling towns and cities of medieval India. This was the world of **traders**, **craftspersons**, and bankers, a dynamic network of people who were producing incredible goods and moving them across the subcontinent and beyond. The towns of this era were the engines of the economy, vibrant hubs where commerce, culture, and religion all came together.

**A City for Every Reason**
Medieval towns came in all shapes and sizes. Some were **temple towns**, which grew up around a major temple. Places like Thanjavur (home of the great Brihadishvara temple) and Tirupati became major urban centers because they attracted thousands of pilgrims, who needed food, lodging, and souvenirs. This created a thriving local economy run by temple authorities. Other towns were **administrative centers**, the capital cities of kings, like Delhi. And many were **commercial towns**, which existed purely for trade and craft production.

**The Makers and the Movers**
The heart of these towns was the incredible skill of their **craftspersons**. The weavers of India were world-famous, producing fine cotton and silk textiles that were desired everywhere. The craft of **Bidri** work, inlaying silver and copper wire onto metal, was famous in the Deccan. These artisans often lived and worked together in specific streets or quarters of the city. Their goods were then moved by powerful communities of **traders**. Some, like the Marwari Oswal, became the great bankers and financiers of the age. Others, like the Banjaras, were long-distance caravan traders, moving bulk goods across the land. The port cities were home to cosmopolitan communities of merchants—Hindu Baniyas, Muslim Bohras, and even Jewish and Christian traders—who connected India to the sea lanes of the world.

**Case Studies in Success: Hampi, Masulipatnam, and Surat**
The city of **Hampi**, the capital of the great Vijayanagara Empire, was a fortress and a commercial and cultural center all in one, described by foreign travelers as being as large and prosperous as Rome. The port of **Masulipatnam** on the east coast was a major hub for textiles, and a battleground for competing European trading companies. But the greatest port of all was **Surat** on the west coast, known as the "Gateway to the West." It was the main hub for trade with West Asia and a major banking center, where a merchant could issue a bill of credit (**hundi**) that would be honored in markets as far away as Egypt. But by the end of this period, these great Indian-run cities began to decline as the Europeans, with their superior naval power, rerouted trade to their new colonial port cities of Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras.

### **Meanwhile, Across the Globe...**
While Indian traders were flourishing, Europe was undergoing a commercial revolution. The Italian city-states of **Venice** and **Genoa** had long dominated the profitable trade in spices coming from the East. But by the 15th and 16th centuries, **Portugal** and **Spain** pioneered new all-sea routes around Africa and across the Atlantic, kicking off the **Age of Discovery**. This shifted the center of economic gravity from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Later, **Amsterdam** in the Netherlands and **London** in England became the new financial and commercial capitals of the world, home to powerful new organizations like the **Dutch and English East India Companies**. These were joint-stock companies that could raise huge amounts of capital and had their own private armies and navies, a new and aggressive model for international trade.

### **Connecting the Past to the Present**
*   **Then (Direct Connections):** The arrival of European trading companies—the Portuguese, Dutch, English, and French—was the single biggest change in this period. Initially, they came as just another group of foreign merchants, competing with Indian and Arab traders for a share of the spice and textile trade. They established "factories" (fortified trading posts) in ports like Surat and Masulipatnam. But unlike other traders, they came with military and naval power, and they slowly began to use this power to control trade, eliminate their rivals, and eventually, interfere in Indian politics.
*   **Now (Lasting Impact & Parallels):** The story of this period is a powerful lesson in how economic power and political power are linked. The great Indian trading cities declined when they lost control of the sea lanes to the Europeans. The concept of the **hundi** is a precursor to modern banking instruments like checks and letters of credit. The rise of the European East India Companies as massive, state-backed multinational corporations that could challenge governments is a historical case study that is still deeply relevant in our age of global corporate power.

### **Grade 7, Chapter 7: The World Beyond the Castle**

### **Tribes, Nomads and Settled Communities**

**(PAGE 1)**

### **The Hidden Kingdoms: India's Forgotten Peoples**

History is usually the story of kings, castles, and cities. But what about the millions of people who lived outside this world? In the vast forests, hills, and deserts of medieval India lived countless **tribal** societies. These communities didn't follow the rules of the **varna** (caste) system, they didn't have kings in the same way, and they preserved their own unique cultures and traditions passed down orally. For centuries, they were the hidden kingdoms of India, interacting with the mainstream society in complex ways.

**Life Beyond the Varna Rules**
Tribal societies were organized around **kinship**, with families and clans forming the basis of their community. Most were farmers who practiced **shifting cultivation** (also known as slash-and-burn agriculture), while others were hunter-gatherers or herders. In some powerful tribes, the land was owned collectively by the whole clan. They had their own gods, their own languages, and their own rich histories, which were preserved not in books but in songs and stories. These tribal societies were not always isolated. They often controlled the forests and the trade routes that passed through them, trading forest produce like honey, wax, and elephants for grain and cloth from the settled villages.

**Nomads on the Move**
Another group living on the move were the **pastoral nomads**. These were communities like the **Banjaras**, who moved with their herds of cattle over long distances. The Banjaras were not just herders; they were the subcontinent's most important long-distance traders, transporting grain on their bullocks for the armies of the Mughal emperors. They were a vital, moving link in the chain of the medieval economy.

**From Tribe to Kingdom: The Gonds and the Ahoms**
Sometimes, a tribal society became so powerful that it created its own large, centralized kingdom. A great example is the **Gonds**, who lived in a vast forested region they called Gondwana. They built a powerful kingdom called **Garha Katanga**, which had 70,000 villages. They grew rich by trapping and exporting wild elephants. Their kingdom was so sophisticated that it had an administrative system and issued its own coins. A similar story unfolded in the northeast, where the **Ahoms** migrated from modern-day Myanmar and established a powerful kingdom in the Brahmaputra valley. For 600 years, they fought off invaders, including the Mughals, and built a large state based on a system of forced labor called **paiks**. Over time, these powerful tribal kingdoms gradually adopted many aspects of mainstream Hindu society, but they always retained their unique identity.

**(PAGE 2)**

### **Meanwhile, Across the Globe...**
The relationship between settled, state societies and tribal or nomadic peoples was a defining feature of world history. On the vast grasslands (steppes) of Central Asia, powerful nomadic empires of **Turks** and **Mongols** constantly threatened the great settled civilizations of China, Persia, and even Europe. Their incredible skill as horsemen and archers made them the most feared warriors in the world. In Africa, the great **Berber** nomads of the Sahara desert controlled the lucrative trans-Saharan trade in gold and salt. In the Americas, vast parts of the continents were home to hundreds of different tribal societies, from the buffalo-hunting tribes of the Great Plains to the complex agricultural societies of the Mississippi valley.

### **Connecting the Past to the Present**
*   **Then (Direct Connections):** The history of medieval India is impossible to understand without the nomads of Central Asia. The founders of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire were themselves descended from these Turco-Mongol nomadic peoples. They brought with them a nomadic heritage of military skill and political organization that they used to conquer and rule the settled agricultural societies of North India. The interaction was a two-way street: the conquerors adopted many aspects of Indian culture, while Indian society was transformed by their arrival.
*   **Now (Lasting Impact & Parallels):** The story of tribal societies is a reminder that history is not a single, linear story. There have always been multiple ways of living and organizing society. Today, many tribal communities around the world are still fighting to preserve their unique cultures, languages, and land rights in the face of pressure from modern states and economies. The historical tension between settled states and mobile, independent peoples continues in modern debates about land use, conservation, and indigenous rights.

### **Grade 7, Chapter 8: A Song for God**

### **Devotional Paths to the Divine**

**(PAGE 1)**

### **The Heart's Revolution: Bhakti, Sufism, and the Poet-Saints**

While kings fought for land and traders chased profits, a very different kind of revolution was sweeping across India. It was a revolution of the heart. Across the subcontinent, charismatic holy men and women—**poet-saints**—were teaching a new, intensely personal, and emotional path to God. They rejected rigid rituals, complex sacrifices, and the authority of orthodox priests. Instead, they taught that anyone, regardless of caste or gender, could find God through pure love and **devotion (bhakti)**. This powerful idea ignited the **Bhakti and Sufi movements**, which transformed the religious landscape of India.

**The Southern Flame and the Philosophers**
The Bhakti movement first caught fire in South India between the 7th and 9th centuries with the **Nayanars** (saints devoted to Shiva) and the **Alvars** (saints devoted to Vishnu). They came from all castes, including those considered "untouchable," and they composed beautiful poetry in the local Tamil language, not Sanskrit, so everyone could understand it. Later, great philosophers like **Shankara** and **Ramanuja** gave these ideas a solid intellectual foundation, debating the nature of God and the individual soul.

**The Two Paths to God in Islam**
A similar movement was happening within Islam. While orthodox Islam focused on the law (Shariat), a mystical path called **Sufism** focused on finding a direct, loving experience of God. **Sufis**, like their Bhakti counterparts, believed that the heart could be trained to see the world in a different way. They composed mystical poetry, developed elaborate methods of meditation and chanting, and often held open gatherings with music (**qawwali**) that attracted both Muslims and Hindus. They sought union with God just as a lover seeks union with their beloved.

**The Northern Explosion: Kabir, Nanak, and Mirabai**
By the 13th century, these devotional waves from the South and the West converged in North India, leading to an explosion of religious creativity. Towering figures emerged who challenged religious divisions. **Kabir**, a weaver from a Muslim family, wrote fiery poems that fiercely rejected both orthodox Hinduism and Islam, mocking priests and external rituals and declaring that God was to be found in every person's heart. **Baba Guru Nanak**, the founder of **Sikhism**, also taught that there was one God and that the outward divisions of religion were meaningless. He established a community based on equality and service. And poet-princesses like **Mirabai** wrote passionate songs of devotion to her beloved Krishna, defying royal conventions to follow her spiritual path.

**(PAGE 2)**

### **Meanwhile, Across the Globe...**
The desire for a more personal, direct connection to the divine was a global phenomenon. In Europe, the **Protestant Reformation** (starting 1517) was a massive religious upheaval led by figures like **Martin Luther**. He challenged the authority of the Pope and argued that salvation came through faith alone, not through the rituals of the Church. This led to the translation of the Bible into local languages so people could read it for themselves—a direct parallel to the Bhakti saints using local languages instead of Sanskrit. Europe was also home to great Christian mystics like **St. Teresa of Avila** and **St. John of the Cross** in Spain, who wrote powerfully about their own intense, personal experiences of God's love, much like the Sufi and Bhakti saints.

### **Connecting the Past to the Present**
*   **Then (Direct Connections):** Sufism was not native to India; it arrived from the wider Islamic world, especially from Persia and Central Asia. Many Sufi orders (**silsilas**) had their origins there. The ideas and poetry of great Persian Sufis like **Rumi** were hugely influential in India. The interaction between Bhakti and Sufism was profound. They often shared ideas, attended each other's gatherings, and found common ground in their focus on love, devotion, and the rejection of social hierarchies. This created a unique syncretic culture where the lines between Hindu and Muslim spirituality often blurred.
*   **Now (Lasting Impact & Parallels):** The legacy of the Bhakti and Sufi saints is immense. The teachings of Guru Nanak evolved into a major world religion, Sikhism. The poetry of Kabir and Mirabai is still sung and recited across India. The Sufi shrines (**dargahs**) of saints like Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer attract millions of devotees of all faiths even today. These movements are a powerful historical testament to India's tradition of religious pluralism and syncretism. Their message that love and devotion are more important than dogma and division is a timeless one, as relevant today as it was centuries ago.

### **Grade 7, Chapter 9: A Tapestry of Cultures**

### **The Making of Regional Cultures**

**(PAGE 1)**

### **One Land, Many Voices: The Birth of a Cultural Rainbow**

How does a region get its own unique "flavor"? Is it the language people speak, the gods they worship, the stories they tell, or the art they create? The answer is all of the above. During the medieval period, the different regions of India began to develop their own distinct cultural identities. This wasn't a process of division, but a creative flowering. A rich tapestry of regional cultures emerged, each weaving together local traditions with influences from other parts of the subcontinent, creating the incredible diversity we see in India today.

**The Language of a Kingdom: The Cheras and Malayalam**
One of the clearest markers of a regional identity is language. In the kingdom of the **Cheras** in the southwest (modern Kerala), rulers began to use the local **Malayalam** language in their official inscriptions alongside Sanskrit. This was a major statement: it showed that the regional language was just as important as the classical language of the elite. The first literary works in Malayalam are also from this period, deeply indebted to Sanskrit but firmly rooted in their own region.

**A God for the People: The Jagannatha Cult**
Religion also took on a distinct regional character. In **Puri, Odisha**, the local tribal deity was gradually identified with **Jagannatha**, a form of the great god Vishnu. But Jagannatha was not just another form of Vishnu; he was the god of the region. The king of the Ganga dynasty even proclaimed himself the "deputy" of the god, ruling the kingdom on his behalf. This fusion of a local deity with a major pan-Indian god gave the region a powerful religious and political identity, centered around the great temple at Puri.

**Art for the Court: Rajputs, Kathak, and Miniatures**
In the courts of the **Rajput** kings of Rajasthan, a unique culture of heroism and valor was celebrated. Stories of their ancestors' heroic deeds were recorded in poems and songs. This warrior ethos was also captured in a new style of painting: **miniature painting**. These small, intensely detailed paintings illustrated scenes from mythology and courtly life, with bold colors and emotional intensity. A distinct "Rajput" style of painting emerged. Further north, in the courts of the Mughals and later in Rajasthan and Lucknow, a new dance form, **Kathak**, evolved from the tradition of storytellers (**kathas**) in temples. It became a sophisticated courtly art form, with its own regional styles or **gharanas**. Every region was becoming a stage for its own unique cultural performance.

---

**(PAGE 2)**

### **Meanwhile, Across the Globe...**
While regional cultures were blossoming in India, a similar process was happening in Europe. The old unity of the Latin-speaking Catholic world was breaking down. The **Renaissance**, which began in Italy, spread north, but in each country, it took on a unique local character. In England, it produced the incredible plays of **William Shakespeare**, written in a powerful and newly confident English language. In Spain, it was the age of **Miguel de Cervantes**, who wrote *Don Quixote*, one of the first great novels in a modern European language. The Protestant Reformation had also led to the Bible being translated into German, English, and French, which helped to standardize these languages and give people a new sense of national-linguistic identity. The idea of "France," "England," and "Spain" as distinct cultural and linguistic entities was being born.

### **Connecting the Past to the Present**
*   **Then (Direct Connections):** The development of regional cultures in India was fueled by the patronage of regional kings. The Rajput rulers, the Sultans of Bengal, and the Chera kings all promoted their local languages, arts, and religious traditions to legitimize their rule and create a sense of regional pride. The Mughal empire, while a centralizing force, also had to interact with these powerful regional cultures. Mughal painting styles, for example, influenced and were influenced by regional schools of painting like the Rajput style.
*   **Now (Lasting Impact & Parallels):** The regional cultures that took shape in this period are the direct ancestors of the modern states of India. The development of languages like Malayalam, Bengali, and others laid the foundation for the linguistic diversity that is a hallmark of India today. The artistic traditions—like Kathak dance, miniature painting, and regional cuisines—are a living heritage that continues to be practiced and celebrated. The story of this era shows that a large, continental civilization can be both unified and diverse, with regional identities flourishing within a broader cultural framework—a model that is very relevant for large, multicultural nations around the world.

### **Grade 7, Chapter 10: The Empire Cracks**

### **Eighteenth-Century Political Formations**

**(PAGE 1)**

### **The Great Scramble: The Fall of the Mughals and the Rise of New Powers**

For nearly two hundred years, the Mughal Empire had been like a giant banyan tree, its authority spreading over the entire subcontinent. But by the early 18th century, after the death of the powerful emperor **Aurangzeb** in 1707, the tree began to wither. Its roots weakened, its branches cracked, and a host of ambitious new powers scrambled to carve out their own space in the sunlight. The 18th century was a time of chaos and opportunity, a great political reshuffling that saw the end of the old imperial order and set the stage for a new, foreign power to eventually take over.

**The Heirs of the Empire**
As the emperor's authority in Delhi weakened, powerful Mughal governors who had been sent to rule rich provinces began to assert their independence. Murshid Quli Khan in **Bengal**, Sa’adat Khan in **Awadh**, and Asaf Jah in **Hyderabad** became the *de facto* rulers of their territories. They still paid lip service to the Mughal emperor, but in reality, they were founding their own regional dynasties, becoming the new Nawabs and Nizams.

**The Warrior-Challengers**
Other groups, who had long resisted Mughal rule, now saw their chance. The **Sikhs** in the Punjab, forged into a disciplined military force by **Guru Gobind Singh**, established their own powerful kingdom under the leadership of Maharaja Ranjit Singh by the end of the century. In the Deccan, the **Marathas**, who had been molded into a formidable fighting force by the legendary warrior-king **Shivaji**, exploded out of their homeland. Under their brilliant prime ministers, the **Peshwas**, the Marathas built a vast empire that stretched across much of India. For a time, it seemed they, not the Mughals, would become the new masters of the subcontinent. Smaller but significant powers like the **Jats** also carved out their own states near Delhi.

**The Final Blow and the New Players**
The final, devastating blows to the hollowed-out Mughal Empire came from foreign invaders. In 1739, the Persian ruler **Nadir Shah** sacked Delhi, massacring its people and carrying away immense treasures, including the famous Peacock Throne and the Koh-i-Noor diamond. This was followed by repeated raids from the Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Abdali. By the mid-18th century, the old empire was shattered. India was a chaotic patchwork of competing regional states—Marathas, Sikhs, Nawabs, and Nizams. And into this power vacuum, a new and dangerous player was beginning to make its move: the **British East India Company**.

---

**(PAGE 2)**

### **Meanwhile, Across the Globe...**
The 18th century in Europe is known as the **Age of Enlightenment**. Thinkers like **Voltaire**, **Rousseau**, and **Montesquieu** were championing new ideas about reason, liberty, human rights, and the separation of powers. These radical ideas would soon lead to two massive political earthquakes: the **American Revolution (1776)**, where the 13 colonies broke away from the British Empire, and the **French Revolution (1789)**, which overthrew the French monarchy. This was also a period of intense global conflict between the two main superpowers, **Britain** and **France**. They fought each other all over the world—in Europe, in North America, and crucially, in India—in a struggle for global dominance. The **Industrial Revolution** was also just beginning in Britain, giving it a technological and economic edge that would soon change the world.

### **Connecting the Past to the Present**
*   **Then (Direct Connections):** The political chaos in India was the perfect opportunity for the European trading companies, especially the British and the French. They began to take sides in the conflicts between the Indian regional powers, offering their military support in exchange for trading rights and territory. The struggle between the Nawab of Bengal and the British, which led to the Battle of Plassey in 1757, was a direct consequence of this new European interference. The "Great Scramble" in India was now part of a global struggle between Britain and France for empire.
*   **Now (Lasting Impact & Parallels):** The 18th century is a crucial turning point in Indian history. It marks the transition from the pre-modern to the modern era. The failure of any single Indian power, like the Marathas, to replace the Mughals and create a new, stable pan-Indian empire left a power vacuum that the British were able to exploit. The regional states that were formed in this period—Bengal, Awadh, Hyderabad, Punjab—are the direct political ancestors of many of the modern states of India and Pakistan. This era serves as a classic historical example of how internal divisions can leave a country vulnerable to foreign intervention.
